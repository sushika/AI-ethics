# 🤖 AI for Recidivism and Judicial Outcomes  

## 📌 Overview  
This project explores the role of **Artificial Intelligence (AI) in recidivism prediction and judicial decision-making**, focusing on ethical implications, biases, and fairness in AI-driven sentencing models. The research discusses how machine learning models are used to assess the likelihood of reoffending and their impact on judicial outcomes, with a critical lens on algorithmic transparency, bias mitigation, and societal consequences.
